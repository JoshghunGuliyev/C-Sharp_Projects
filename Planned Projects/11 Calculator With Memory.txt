Calculator With Memory

The program will allow user to perform operations like on a calculator.
The user can stop the process of calculation at any time by typing a special keyword
like "stop" or "exit". The user can also use special keywords to store something to a memory
or load if from a memory (for example "mem" and "rec").

The whole program can look like this:


Welcome to calculator
(type "exit" to exit, "mem" to store memory and "rec" to recall memory)

Enter number:
15
Enter operator:
+
Enter number:
10

The result is: 25
Enter operator:
-
Enter number:
3

The result is: 22
Enter operator:
mem

Current result (22) was stored to memory.
Enter operator:
*
Enter number:
2

The results is: 44
Enter operator:
+
Enter number:
rec

The result is: 66
Enter operator:
exit

Goodbye


The program will also be able to save the memory in between different calculations - by saving the number to a file.
When the program is next started the memory will be loaded from the file




BONUS:
1. Implement unary operators (operations that do not require second number), for example square, or square root, or log.
